I am a PhD student at the University of Lausanne, focusing on “Multi-scale structural analysis of fracture networks” under the supervision of Dr. Anindita Samsu.

I hold an MSc in Basin Analysis from the University of the State of Rio de Janeiro and a BSc in Geological Engineering from the Federal University and School of Mines of Ouro Preto.

My professional background includes working as a reservoir geomodeler in the energy industry, where I applied structural and geostatistical techniques to model 3D subsurface geology for projects along the Brazilian margin.

In my PhD journey, I am excited to re-engage in field-based studies and explore advanced techniques for acquiring and mapping structural data across multiple scales.

My research focuses on establishing hierarchical relationships between brittle structures, exploring the applicability of scaling structural information from outcrop to regional analysis.
